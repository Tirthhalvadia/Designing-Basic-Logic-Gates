# Designing-Basic-Logic-Gates
**Project Overview**

This project involves the proficient design and simulation of basic logic gates including Inverter, NAND, and NOR gates using the Cadence Virtuoso software. The work encompasses the creation of schematics, layouts, and test-benches for each logic gate, ensuring that all designs are error-free and function as intended through rigorous validation processes.

**Features**

**Schematic Design:** Developed clear and functional schematics for Inverter, NAND, and NOR gates.

**Layout Design:** Created precise layouts, resolving Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) issues to ensure error-free designs.

**Parasitic Extraction:** Performed parasitic capacitance extraction to account for real-world physical effects.

**Post-Layout Simulations:** Conducted post-layout transient simulations to verify the performance and functionality of the circuits under realistic conditions.

**Tools Used**

**Cadence Virtuoso:** Utilized for designing schematics, layouts, and performing simulations.

**Validation**

**DRC and LVS Checks**: Ensured that all layouts pass DRC and LVS checks, confirming that the physical layout matches the schematic design without any rule violations.

**Parasitic Extraction and Transient Simulations:** Performed to analyze and confirm the circuit's performance, accounting for real-world effects.
